Program building blocks:
- each function/block broken down to simplify debugging/edits
- in assembly, blocks = subroutines
  - 8800's stack organization helps this
  - lower level = simpler task, printing a char
  - higher level = complex task, arranging a whole sentence
  - each call -> return address to stack
  - "nesting" done by stack
- show simplified program schematic
- focus on one subroutine = one task
