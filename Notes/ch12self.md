Program building blocks:
- each function/block broken down to simplify debugging/edits
- in assembly, blocks = subroutines
  - 8800's stack organization helps this
  - lower level = simpler task, printing a char
  - higher level = complex task, arranging a whole sentence
  - each call -> return address to stack
  - "nesting" done by stack
- show simplified program schematic
- focus on one subroutine = one task
- CO -> console Output, sends character in accumulator to CON device, preserves other registers
- CI -> receives a single ASCII character from the console
- difference between them is the change in the BDOS code across WCONF to RCONF (read console function vs write), and ANI 7FH (ANd Immediate value with accumulator)
- used to mask off the high order bit, should always be done when received an ASCII character, to allow parity bits
- START establishes the user stack
- START1 introduces ComPare Immediate (CPI) to check current input character for CTRL Z (our interrupt)
